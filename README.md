## About/Problem Definition

- Our team's objective is to analyse and predict the liekly survivors of the titanic disasters using passengers' data.
- The underlying motivation is provide new insights on the titanic incident by:
  - identifying factors that may influence passengers' survivor rate.
  - predicting the likelihood of an individual's survival

- Such insights may be able to tell us more about different demographics' chances of survival and factors that affect their survival rate.

- We hope that such insights can be useful in the future for:
  - identifying undiscovered loopholes in safety measures or precautions
  - further improving existing safety infrastructure
