## About/Problem Definition

Our team's objective is to analyse and predict the likely survivors of the titanic disasters using passengers' data.

The underlying motivation is provide new insights on the titanic incident by:
- identifying factors that may influence passengers' survivor rate.
- predicting the likelihood of an individual's survival

Such insights may be able to tell us more about different demographics' chances of survival and factors that affect their survival rate.

We hope that such insights can be useful in the future for:
- identifying undiscovered loopholes in safety measures or precautions
- further improving existing safety infrastructure
